    <p>A good chocolate cake can be enjoyed on just about any special occasion: birthdays, anniversaries, graduations, potluck parties. It's a classic! This chocolate cake is the new and improved version of our original recipe: it's delicious, moist, and fluffy, and no one will even guess it's completely plant-based!</p>
    <p><i>Definitely a recipe you need to try!</i></p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
       <li>unsweetened milk <i>milk of choice</i></li>
       <li>white vinegar</li>
       <li>all purpose flour</li>
       <li>cocoa powder</li>
       <li>baking powder</li>
       <li>baking soda</li>
       <li>salt</li>
       <li>vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <p>for decoration</p>
    <ul>
        <li>chocolate shavings</li>
        <li>fresh berries</li>
        <li>fresh mint leaves</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Lightly grease two 8-inch (20 cm) round cake pans with oil and line the bottom with cut-out round pieces of parchment paper the size of the base of the cake pans.</li>
        <li>To a medium bowl, add the milk and vinegar, and mix. Set aside. You will see it starts to curdle, and this is what creates vegan buttermilk.</li>
        <li>Place a sieve over a large bowl, and sift all the dry ingredients through it. Mix together, and then create a shallow well in the middle. Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).</li>
        <li>Returning to the medium bowl containing the buttermilk, add all of the remaining wet ingredients. Mix thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Add all the wet ingredients to the shallow well in the dry ingredients and mix until everything is just combined, but be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li>Divide the cake batter between the two cake pans. Gently tap the pans on the counter a couple of times to level out the batter and to remove any air bubbles. Bake in the centre rack of the preheated oven for 35 minutes, or until a thin wooden skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean.</li>
        <li>Decorate the chocolate cake with desired toppings, and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
